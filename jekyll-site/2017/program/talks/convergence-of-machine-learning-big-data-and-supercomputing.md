abstract: >

  Machine learning, big data, and simulation challenges have led to a proliferation of computing hardware and software solutions. Hyperscale data centers, accelerators, and programmable logic can deliver enormous performance via a wide range of analytic environments and data storage technologies. Apache Accumulo is a unique technology with the potential to enable all of these fields.  Effectively exploiting Accumulo in these fields requires mathematically rigorous interfaces that allow users to focus on their domains. Mathematically rigorous interfaces are at the core MIT Lincoln Laboratory Supercomputing Center (LLSC) and enable the LLSC to deliver Apache Accumulo  o thousands of scientists and engineers. This talk discusses the rapidly evolving computing landscape and how mathematically rigorous interfaces are the key to exploiting Apache Accumulo's advanced capabilities.

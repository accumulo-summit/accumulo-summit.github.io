abstract: >

  We all know that AI and Machine Learning (ML) are the new hotness in the big data space. There is plenty of focus on fancy ML algorithms, but what is really required to put something like a Recommendation Engine into production? The truth is, it requires a hefty amount of data engineering and data science. During this talk, attendees will step through a real-life case study on putting a Recommendation Engine into production and learn why Accumulo was an ideal choice for use in this particular situation.

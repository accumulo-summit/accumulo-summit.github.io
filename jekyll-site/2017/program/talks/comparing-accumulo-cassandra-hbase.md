abstract: >

  Organizations looking to use a NoSQL data store based on Big Table face a challenge when deciding between alternatives. Often superficial differences are overblown or worse, subtle differences aren't discovered until it's too late. In this talk we compare and contrast Apache Accumulo against Apache Cassandra and Apache HBase, diving deep into design differences and subtleties that may hinder a project only after reaching a certain amount of usage or data storage.

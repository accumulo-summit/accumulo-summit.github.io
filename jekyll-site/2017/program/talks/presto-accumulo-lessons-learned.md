abstract: >

  <p>The Presto/Accumulo connector has been in production for over 18 months. It's been successful overall, but we have had some pain points along the way with some tech debt as well as design decisions.</p>
  <p>During this session, we'll briefly review the Accumulo connector for Presto as well as the use case that drove the initial implementation.
  We'll discuss the pain points we have experienced with the connector, and the latest features and changes to the connector to improve query performance, ingestion, and ease of use.</p>

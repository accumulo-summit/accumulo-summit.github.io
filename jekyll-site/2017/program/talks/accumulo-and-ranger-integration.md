abstract: >

  <p>Apache Ranger provides an extensible framework for distributed policy decision and enforcement with centralized administration as well as auditing authorization decisions within the Apache Hadoop ecosystem. Apache Accumulo's pluggable security model enables the integration of Ranger providing GUI and REST driven authorization management, user and group synchronization with LDAP endpoints, and provides a centralized authorization audit repository.</p>

  <p>The combination of Ranger and Accumulo enables alignment with NIST ABAC standards for the Hadoop ecosystem. This talk will cover why that matters, the mechanics of Ranger's authorization model, and demonstrate an integration of the two systems.</p>

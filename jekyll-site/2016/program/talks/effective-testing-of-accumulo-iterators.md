  Apache Accumuloâ€™s Iterator are a powerful API which developers leverage to efficiently perform operations like aggregations and filters, reducing latency of these operations by orders of magnitude. However, Iterators are notoriously difficult to implement correctly. This talk will introduce an Iterator testing harness designed to improve code quality on newly created iterators, catch common runtime pitfalls, and present an end-to-end testing solution for Iterators.

abstract: >

  In this presentation, we will describe Graphulo, a tool built for Apache Accumulo to enable in-database graph analytics. Specifically, we will describe its architecture, usage, and application to graph algorithms of interest to the community. Graphs are used in many applications to determine the relationship between various entities and understand how complex networks are structured. As the size of graphs increase rapidly, performing efficient large-scale graph analytics can be difficult. Graphulo leverages the Accumulo computational infrastructure to perform graph analytics directly in-database. Fundamentally, Graphulo conforms to the GraphBLAS standard that has demonstrated its ability to represent diverse graph analytics. This ensures that Graphulo can be applied to a wide variety of analytics and can grow with the GraphBLAS community. Further, this representation allows us to naturally connect Graphulo with emerging polystore database systems. Initial results obtained using Graphulo indicate scalability and applicability to a wide variety of graph problems. Finally, we solicit feedback from the Accumulo community and describe our future development goals.

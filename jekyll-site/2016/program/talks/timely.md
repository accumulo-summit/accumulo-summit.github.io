abstract: >

  Some of the most popular metric visualization tools work really well for smaller deployments, but have issues dealing with large amounts of data. Timely started after an integration of OpenTSDB with Accumulo failed to meet our needs. Timely can be used to gain visibility into the performance of your networks and hardware, your Hadoop cluster and Accumulo database, and your application. In this talk we will cover the current implementation and APIs, security model, deployment models, and our roadmap.

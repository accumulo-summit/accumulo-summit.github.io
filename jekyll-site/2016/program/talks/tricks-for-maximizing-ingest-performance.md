  Many organizations choose to use Accumulo for its high ingest rates. When use in a well architected application, Accumulo performs better than any of the other databases in its class. However, there are several concepts of distributed computing that can lead an under engineered application to perform poorly. In this talk, we will present Accumulo's ingest architecture, discuss the most critical areas that determine application performance, and detail a highly optimized document store application. We will then show how the design of our document store achieves millions of key/value writes per second per node in a sustainable and scalable operational environment.

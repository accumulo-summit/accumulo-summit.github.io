  <p>Accumulo Collections is a lightweight library that dramatically simplifies development of fast NoSQL applications by encapsulating many powerful, distributed features of Accumulo in the familiar Java Collections interface. Accumulo is a giant sorted map with rich server-side functionality, and our AccumuloSortedMap is a robust java SortedMap implementation that is backed by an Accumulo table. It handles serialization and foreign keys, and provides extensive server-side features like entry timeout, aggregates, filtering, efficient one-to-many mapping, partitioning and sampling. Users can define custom server-side transformations and aggregates with Accumulo iterators.</p>

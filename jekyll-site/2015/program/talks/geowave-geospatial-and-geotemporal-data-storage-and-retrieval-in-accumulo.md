abstract: >

  GeoWave is an open source software project developed at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) in collaboration with Booz Allen Hamilton and RadiantBlue Technologies.  GeoWave leverages Accumulo’s architecture to manage petabytes of raster and vector data by serving as an enterprise level geospatial data store.  To efficiently index geospatial data and answer queries with geospatial constraints, GeoWave employs a space filling curve to form bidirectional mappings between multi-dimensional data and Accumulo’s sorted row identifiers.  As a complete offering, Geowave provides a plug-in to the Open Source Geospatial Foundation’s GeoServer platform, enabling management of geospatial data and associated attributes through Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standard services, and map-reduce input/output formats to support scalable post-processing and analysis of geospatial data.

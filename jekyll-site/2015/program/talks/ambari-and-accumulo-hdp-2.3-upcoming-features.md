  The upcoming Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP) 2.3 includes significant additions to Accumulo, within the project itself and in its interactions with the larger Hadoop ecosystem.This session will cover high-level changes that improve usability, management and security of Accumulo. Administrators of Accumulo now have the ability to deploy, manage and dynamically configure Accumulo clusters using Apache Ambari. As a part of Ambari integration, the metrics system in Accumulo has been updated to use the standard “Hadoop Metrics2” metrics subsystem which provides native Ganglia and Graphite support as well as supporting the new Ambari Metrics System. On the security front,Accumulo was also improved to support client authentication via Kerberos, while earlier versions of Accumulo only supported Kerberos authentication for server processes.With these changes,Accumulo clients can authenticate solely using their Kerberos identity across the entire Hadoop cluster without the need to manage passwords.

abstract: >

  In recent years we’ve seen an increased willingness by government agencies to transfer technology and provide more open access to data. This increased sharing opens the door for further research and contributions by commercial entities, contractors, and individuals. The panelists have extensive experience shepherding software through this process and will discuss their experiences. Aaron Cordova and Billie Rinaldi are founders of the Accumulo project which transitioned from a government technology, through the Apache Incubator process, to a top-level Apache project where they serve as Project Management Committee Members and Committers. Joe Witt is the founder of the recently open-sourced Nifi project, which is currently undergoing Apache Incubation where he serves as a Project Management Committee Member and Committer.

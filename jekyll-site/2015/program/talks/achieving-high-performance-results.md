abstract: >

  <p>Open source frameworks can provide access to large amounts of data in a productive and fault resilient way on scale-out commodity hardware systems. Implementing High Performance Data Analytic systems can maintain framework productivity and improve data analyst performance. One proven approach is integrating the open source framework with High Performance Computing hardware. In order to achieve this performance, the framework must be viewed as an application and migrated to the HPC system, and may include the surgical replacement of key functions, creating a custom version of the framework.</p>

  <p>We will discuss the merits and procedures standing up open source frameworks, such as Accumulo, on an HPC-class system. Additionally the panelists will share best practices for addressing bottlenecks, improving performance and working with the open source community.</p>

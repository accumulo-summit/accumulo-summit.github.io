abstract: >

  <p>In this first meetup we'll introduce ourselves, provide a demo of the latest <a href="https://nifi.incubator.apache.org/">Apache NiFi</a> features, and plan out what we'll cover for the next meetup. Two local companies have both offered their spaces for us to have recurring meetups so we should be in great shape! Please help us get the word out about the meetup.</p>

  <p>While Accumulo Summit is pleased to be hosting the First Ever Apache NiFi Meetup, please note that <strong> this meetup has a separate registration</strong>.  Registration is <strong>completely free and open to all</strong> &mdash; you need not attend Accumulo Summit in order to attend this meetup.</p>

abstract: >

  According to the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (2014), women make up 47% of the United Stateâ€™s workforce, but are under-represented in some of the higher paying science and engineering occupations. Why is this? What can we do to increase the presence of women in engineering? This discussion examines what is needed to build a better foundation of women in engineering. Women and men are invited to join this discussion.

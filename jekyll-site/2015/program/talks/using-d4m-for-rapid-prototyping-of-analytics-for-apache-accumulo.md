abstract: >

  <p>The ability to collect and analyze large amounts of data is a growing problem amongst the scientific community. The growing gap between data and users calls for innovative tools that address the challenges faced by big data: volume, velocity and variety.</p>

  <p>This tutorial aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a range of tools and techniques that they can use in conjunction with Apache Accumulo to close this gap. The proposed tutorial will focus on building solid fundamentals using a rapid prototyping tool – the Dynamic Distributed Dimensional Data Model (D4M) – to quickly prototype new algorithms that can be tested with Apache Accumulo. The tutorial will be suitable for participants from all levels of experience using Apache Accumulo. The tutorial will begin with a general introduction of the big data landscape in order to align terminology and provide a unified view of the system regardless of participant background. The tutorial will then discuss systems engineering and how it applies to big data systems. We will then introduce D4M and provide examples of D4M being used for analytics such as dimensional analysis and background model fitting. We will then discuss current areas of research on security and privacy as well as graph algorithms. Tutorial slides will be distributed to participants and brief demonstrations will be used to reinforce concepts.</p>

  <p>The goals of the tutorial are 1) to provide participants with a theoretical foundation of big data; 2) to demonstrate how Accumulo can be used to solve real problems from diverse domains; and 3) describe future avenues of research. This tutorial provides a deep dive into the topics presented at the 2014 Accumulo Summit in the presentation entitled: “Addressing Big Data Challenges through Innovative Architecture, Databases and Software”.</p>

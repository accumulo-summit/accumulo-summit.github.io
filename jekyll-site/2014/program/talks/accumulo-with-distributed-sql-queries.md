abstract: >

  <p>SQL queries are often the #1 requested feature of key/value stores.  Argyle will present our integration of Accumulo with Facebookâ€™s PrestoDB distributed query engine.  We will discuss:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Data locality between PrestoDB and Accumulo</li>
    <li>Predicate pushdown for row keys</li>
    <li>Leveraging a secondary index for column based queries</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The talk will include a live demonstration of big data benchmark queries.</p>

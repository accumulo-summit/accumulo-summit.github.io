abstract: >

  Labels in Accumulo provide great power and flexibility. However, nearly everyone makes the same set of mistakes when first applying labels to their data.  In this talk, we will follow two data architects as they first come to the labeling system in Accumulo, and see how they work their way out of the pitfalls they create for themselves.  Along the way, they'll learn about Accumulo's pluggable security architecture surrounding the core functionality of the labeling system.

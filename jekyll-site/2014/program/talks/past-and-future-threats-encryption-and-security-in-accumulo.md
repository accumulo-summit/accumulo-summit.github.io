abstract: >

  The early Accumulo developers made security a core part of Accumulo's codebase. As the open source community around Accumulo continues to thrive, this talk examines the current state of Accumulo's security features.  The talk will detail some exciting developments in the upcoming 1.6 release, which include enhancements around encryption at rest and in motion.  We will also take a broader look at new use cases suggesting a wider set of threats, and how current and future work addresses those threats.

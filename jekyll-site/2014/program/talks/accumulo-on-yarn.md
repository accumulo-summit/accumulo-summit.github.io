abstract: >

    In their OSDI 2006 paper, Google describes that "Bigtable depends on a cluster management system for scheduling jobs, managing resources on shared machines, dealing with machine failures, and monitoring machine status."  Until recently, no such system existed for Apache Accumulo to rely upon.  Apache Hadoop 2 introduced the Yarn resource management system to the Hadoop ecosystem.  This talk will describe the benefits Yarn can provide for Accumulo installations and how the Slider project (proposed for the Apache Incubator) makes it easier to deploy long-running applications on Yarn. It will describe the details of the Accumulo App Package for Slider and how to use Slider to deploy an Accumulo instance, as well as how instances can be actively managed by other applications such as Apache Ambari.

  Apache Accumulo has long held a reputation for enabling high-throughput operations in write-heavy workloads. In this talk, we use the Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark (YCSB) to put real numbers on Accumulo performance. We then compare these numbers to previous versions, to other databases, and wrap up with a discussion of parameters that can be tweaked to improve them.

abstract: >

  Most users of Accumulo start developing applications on a single machine and will to scale to up to four orders of magnitude more machines without having to rewrite. In this talk we describe techniques for designing applications for scale, planning a large scale cluster, tuning the cluster for high speed ingest, dealing with a large amount of data over time, and unique features of Accumulo for taking advantage of up to ten thousand nodes in a single instance. We also include the largest public metrics gathered on Accumulo clusters to date and include a discussion of overcoming practical limits to scaling in the future.

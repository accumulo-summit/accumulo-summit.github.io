abstract: >

  Accumulo includes a remarkable breadth of testing frameworks, which helps to ensure its correctness, performance, robustness, and protection of your vital data. This presentation takes you on a tour from Accumulo's basic unit testing up through performance and scalability testing exercised on running clusters. Learn the extent to which Accumulo is put through its paces before it is released, and get ideas for how you can similarly enhance testing of your own code.

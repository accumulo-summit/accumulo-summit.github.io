abstract: >

  <p>Apache Accumulo (like all distributed, data stores) provides scalability at the cost of increased complexity.  While Accumuloâ€™s algorithms for handling fault tolerance or distributing load across a cluster may always be complex to the average Accumulo user, there are parts of Accumulo that can be simplified and improved to provide a better user experience. It should be easy for users to install and run Accumulo, write a simple Accumulo client, and troubleshoot common issues.  This talk will cover how the Accumulo user experience has improved with Accumulo 2.0 and the creation of the Uno and Muchos tools.  The talk will end with a discussion of possible future work to make the user experience better.</p>

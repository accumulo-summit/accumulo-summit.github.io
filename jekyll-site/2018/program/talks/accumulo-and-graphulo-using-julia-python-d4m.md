abstract: >

  <p>Julia and Python have become dominant languages in scientific computing, prompting the implementation of D4M in those languages. Graphulo provides a convenient mechanism for analyzing data within Accumulo using in-database graph analytics. The MATLAB®/Octave interface for Graphulo, accessible through the D4M library, provides both Accumulo and Graphulo capabilities to analysts comfortable with the matrix-based syntax of MATLAB and D4M. By introducing the Julia and Python implementations of D4M, including the Graphulo connectors, we have made D4M, Graphulo, and Accumulo more accessible to the Julia and Python community – already being explored is using Julia D4M to use Accumulo to store human brain-scale sparse deep neural networks.</p>
  <p>In this presentation, we will introduce to the Accumulo community the Julia and Python implementations of D4M and demonstrate how users can leverage those to interface with Graphulo and Accumulo.</p>

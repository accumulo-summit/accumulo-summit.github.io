title: The Case for a Managed Accumulo Service in the Cloud

categories:

- Use Case

abstract: >

  <p>Cloud providers have started to make some technologies available as managed services, such as Amazon's Relational Database Service (RDS) and Microsoft's DocumentDB. Using these services' APIs can vastly simplify and accelerate application development and requires far less of a support burden through automated scaling and maintenance.</p>

  <p>By adopting Accumulo as a managed service, cloud providers could open the door to dramatically faster adoption by organizations with high scalability and security requirements, such as those in defense, intelligence, health, finance, and other highly regulated industries. In this talk we discuss what such a service might look like and what opportunities exist for new models of data protection and sharing that result.</p>

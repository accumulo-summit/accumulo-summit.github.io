abstract: >

  <p>Fluo is a premier Accumulo extension just waiting for a killer app. Bitcoin has enough buzz to get people interested in any associated technology. I present my work combining Fluo and Bitcoin to demonstrate how Fluo can optimize maintaining Bitcoin statistics in the face of Bitcoinâ€™s eventually consistent peer-to-peer network. My goal is to use the Bitcoin blockchain mechanics to show how Fluo can optimize a Map/Reduce pipeline that you can extend to optimize your own pipeline.</p>

abstract: >

  <p>Are your customers looking to build diverse machine learning (ML) solutions on Accumulo?  In this talk, we walk through three production ML use cases that require users to interact with Accumulo in very different ways - Supply Chain Risk, Cyber Monitoring, and Forensic Document Search.  We discuss the surprising result that we are able to support all of these use cases using the a common set of Accumulo tables.</p>

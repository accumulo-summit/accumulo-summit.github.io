abstract: >

  This 20 minutes talk describes an automated data processing system, ComputableFacts, whose goal is to recover information from unstructured data in a variety of formats (such as Microsoft Office or Adobe PDF documents, emails, web pages, etc.) and convert it into a more usable form. Its key features are:

  Security:
    <ul>
      <li>Enforce authorizations across multiple access models to the database: batch, interactive and real-time.</li>
    </ul>

  Data Engineering:
    <ul>
      <li>Extract data and metadata from a variety of sources and file formats</li>
      <li>Provides a uniform representation of all data, regardless of its initial structure or format</li>
    </ul>

  Knowledge Engineering:
    <ul>
      <li>Build facts databases manually and/or automatically</li>
      <li>Automatically derive new facts using rules</li>
      <li>Execute complex queries</li>
    </ul>

  Knowledge Dissemination:
    <ul>
      <li>Allow users to create alerts</li>
      <li>Allow users to share and comment on documents</li>
      <li>Allow users to create and export query-focused datasets</li>
      <li>Allow users to rate documents. Later, recommend them documents of interest</li>
    </ul>

abstract: >

  <p>Out of the box, Accumulo's strengths are difficult to appreciate without first building an application that showcases its capabilities to handle massive amounts of data. Unfortunately, building such an application is non-trivial for many would-be users, which affects Accumulo's adoption.</p>

  <p>In this talk, we introduce Datawave, a complete ingest, query, and analytic framework for Accumulo. Datawave, recently open-sourced by the National Security Agency, capitalizes on Accumulo's capabilities, provides an API for working with structured and unstructured data, and boasts a robust, flexible, and scalable backend.</p>

  <p>We'll do a deep dive into Datawave's project layout, table structures, and APIs in addition to demonstrating the Datawave quickstart—a tool that makes it incredibly easy to hit the ground running with Accumulo and Datawave without having to develop a complete application.</p>

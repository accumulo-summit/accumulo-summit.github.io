title: Modeling Entities in Accumulo

categories:

- Design

abstract: >

  <p>Many organizations can benefit from modeling the real-world things they care about, including their attributes and relationships, using an entity-based data model. Examples including consolidating customer information from various sources, fusing information about potential threats and assets in an area of interest from multiple types and sources of intelligence, and coalescing patient data for a more complete view and better diagnoses.</p>

  <p>We discuss our experiences building an application for modeling data as entities on Accumulo, outline which parts of the Accumulo API are best suited for this, and explore various trade-offs that can be useful when considering flexibility and performance.</p>
